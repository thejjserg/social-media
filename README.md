# Social Media Project

This project is based off of the **Coursera Project Network**'s, **Clean and Analyze Social Media Usage Data with Python** guided project. 

## Objectives
The Objectives of this project are to
1. Increase client reach and engagement
2. Achieve their social media goals and provide data-driven recommendations
3. Gain valuable insights that will help improve social media performance

This project will showcase skills in Python's **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Pandas** libraries, statistical **Python Programming**, **Data Analysis**, and **Data Visualization**. 

## Project Plan
1. Import required libraries
2. Generate random data for the social media data
3. Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and explore the data
4. Clean the data
5. Visualize and analyze the data

## Project Scenario
In this project, we will play the role as an entry-level data analyst at a social media agency. We will help create a comprehensive report that analyzes the performance of different categories of social media posts. Our team is responsible for analyzing the performance of different types of posts based on categories, such as health, family, food, etc. to help clients optimize their social media strategy and increase their reach and engagement. 

We will be using Python to automatically extract posts from one or more categories. Python will also be used to clean, analyze, and visualize the randomly generated data. The team will use our analysis to make data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. This feature will help the marketing agency deliver posts on time, within budget, and gain fast results!
